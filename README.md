# Megiston-Incremental

Version 0.19:
 - Renamed triangles tab to shapes
 - Moved cut to shapes tab ('cut' name is subject to change, so is 'second triangle')
 - Cut is now a triangle operator that multiplies main triangle index
 - Unified shapes, added maxall for cut and second triangle
 - Changed costs of cut and second triangle
 - Added new mechanic: Pyramid
 - Added new achievements
 - Added new flip upgrades
 - Minor pre-square balance changes
 - Visual changes, mostly in upgrade screen
 - Fixed bugs, improved performance
 
There were a lot of changes to internal structure. I tried to fix it on loading from older version save, but some error could probably slip by.
